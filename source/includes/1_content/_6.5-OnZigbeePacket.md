## SendZigbeePacket
This function sends a raw Zigbee packet to a Zigbee Binding. This functionality supports both the current Control 4 (EmberNet) as well as ZigBee Pro 1.1 transports. This API should not be invoked during OnDriverInit.

###### Available from 1.6.0.


### Signature

`C4:SendZigbeePacket (strPacket,nProfileID, nClusterID, nGroupID, nSourceEndpoint, ndestinationEndpoint)`


| Parameter | Description |

| num | Profile ID associated with the data packet |

### Usage Note

The following parameters are ignored when using the Control 4 (Embernet) Zigbee stack: 

- nProfileID
- nClusterID
- nGroupID
- nSouceEndpoint
- nDestinationEndpoint

Packet data is still sent in the strPacket parameter. If using ZigBee Pro, all data (including strPacket) must conform to ZigBee Pro format. 


### Example

```lua
g_SequenceNumber=g_sequenceNumber + 1
strPacket = "0" .. Chartype .. string.format(%04x",g_SequenceNumber) .. 	c4.dm.lv 100"
```
